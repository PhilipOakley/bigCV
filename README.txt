I recently saw the Eng-Jobs article -

https://engineering-jobs.theiet.org/article/the-biggest-cv-mistakes-you-ll-ever-make/

And I thought it looked ideal to plagiarise (explicitly!) to reframe the 
expectations for the CEng/IEng application forms where:

* there is no job.
* the reviewers _will_ read it all.
* its about you, not what you can do for them.
* etc.

i.e. I would retain as much as possible, while refocusing on what I 
typically have to say to candidates to get them away from writing corporate 
trivia.

The IET, via Georgina Bloomfield, should have the copyright for 
me to have a go at doing a 'plagiarised' version for Professional 
registration.
